Project: Mahjong 胡牌 Probability Simulator (Flutter App)

Objective

Develop a Flutter-based mobile application that allows users to simulate Mahjong "胡牌" probability by randomly generating hands of 5, 8, or 11 tiles (筒子 only). The app calculates the percentage of valid "胡牌" hands based on specific rules.

胡牌定義 (Winning Hand Definition)

A hand is considered "胡牌" if it meets the following structure:

5 tiles: 1 meld (sequence or triplet) + 1 pair

8 tiles: 2 melds + 1 pair

11 tiles: 3 melds + 1 pair

Valid Meld Types:

Sequence (順子): Three consecutive numbers in the same suit (e.g., 1-2-3).

Triplet (刻子): Three of the same number (e.g., 3-3-3).

Invalid Hands:

Hands that cannot be decomposed into the required number of melds and one pair are considered not 胡牌.

A group of four of the same tile (槓子) is not recognized unless used as a triplet within the rules.

Target Platform

Flutter (iOS / Android)

Core Features & Functions

1. Simulation Control Panel

Tile Count Selection: Radio buttons or dropdown to select simulation mode (5 tiles, 8 tiles, 11 tiles)

Control Buttons:

Run: Starts or resumes the simulation

Pause: Temporarily halts the simulation

Stop: Stops and resets the simulation

2. Result Display Panel

Live Statistics:

Total number of hands simulated

Number of valid "胡牌" hands

Estimated probability (percentage)

Last 3 Hands History:

Display last three simulated hands

Indicate whether each is 胡牌 or not

Example:

1 2 3 4 4 - 胡牌 ✅

3 3 3 5 6 - 非胡牌 ❌

3. Simulation Engine

Randomly generates tile hands from 1 to 9 (representing 一筒 to 九筒)

Allows infinite copies of any tile (unlimited tile count assumption)

Internally checks the validity of the hand based on strict rules

Runs in a background isolate to avoid UI blocking

UI Requirements

Minimalistic and clean interface

Use numerals 1-9 (e.g., "1" represents 一筒)

Clear result labeling (✅/❌)

Button state changes when paused/stopped/running
